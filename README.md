Work in progress - Cubing-related command-line tools

To start: a `trainer` tool that provides scrambles for a set of algorithms that one is trying to learn, with the scrambles created by using https://github.com/muodov/kociemba to solve the cube state created by applying the algorithm plus a random PLL to disguise the scramble.
